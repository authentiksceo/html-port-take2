<p>Everything is working for me at all times.</p>

<p>Reality relies more on perspective than realtiy itself.</p>

<p>Your mind is a tool that must be mastered in order to be properly used.</p>

<h2>Expanding Your Mind</h2>

<p>In order to expand your mind you must first learn to quiet your mind...</p>

<p>Start here to begin this process:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Sit down in a quiet space...</li>
    <li>Close your eyes and feel the floor underneath you...</li>
    <li>Take a deep breath in and hold for 10 seconds...</li>    
    <li>Slowly breathe out for 10 seconds...</li>
    <li>Then slowly take another breath over 10 seconds...</li>
    <li>Repeat until you feel you feel the pressure in your body dissapate.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Deeper Meaning</h2>
<p>Everything is working for me at all times.</p>
<p>Reality relies more on perspective than realtiy itself.</p>
<p>Your mind is a tool that must be mastered in order to be properly used.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Expanding Your Mind</h2>
<p>In order to expand your mind you must first learn to quiet your mind...</p>
<p>Start here to begin this process:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Sit down in a quiet space...</li>
    <li>Close your eyes and feel the floor underneath you...</li>
    <li>Take a deep breath in and hold for 10 seconds...</li>    
    <li>Slowly breathe out for 10 seconds...</li>
    <li>Then slowly take another breath over 10 seconds...</li>
    <li>Repeat until you feel you feel the pressure in your body dissapate.</li>
</ol>

    There's an amazing song that I really appreciate. <br>
    It starts with the following verse: <br>
    <ul>
        <p>I sit in my car outside restaurants and bars</p>
        <p>Reading about what's inside</p>
        <p>I look up opinions 'bout news and religion</p>
        <p>So I don't have to use my own mind</p>
        <p>I should call my friends...</p>
        <p>But I read their posts instead.</p>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>There's a lot of truth to this verse. It speaks to the reality of the digital world we live in today... no matter how great the content we consume may be, nothing is quite the same as experiencing the world irl.</p>
<p>Here are two more photos of mountains that I really like:</p>
